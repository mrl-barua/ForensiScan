- **Enhanced Typography**: Added consistent font styling with proper hierarchy
- **Particle Effects**: Integrated subtle particle system for visual interest
- **Smooth Animations**: Improved scale and fade animations with better easing
- **Visual Consistency**: Matches the main application's blue-purple gradient theme

### 2. Main Splash Screen (SplashScreen.tscn)

- **Professional Layout**: Complete redesign with centered panel containing all elements
- **Enhanced Branding**: Proper logo display with animated search icon

  - Color transitions based on progress
- **Better Information Architecture**:
  - Clear app title and subtitle
  - Organized loading messages with emojis
  - Version information in appropriate location
- **Interactive Elements**: Animated icon that pulses during loading
- **Background Effects**: Particle system for visual appeal

### 3. Enhanced Scripting

- **Better Animation Timing**: Coordinated animations for smooth transitions
- **Progressive Feedback**: Dynamic loading messages with visual feedback
